# Personal NeoVim setup
### My personal neovim configuration.

It assumes that there is a vim configuration that it will use to configure neovim.

## Clone
Clone the dot-neovim repo to a local directory.

```
git clone git://github.com/mrxcitement/dot-neovim.git ~/github/dot-neovim
```

## Install
If you allready have a neovim configuration, make sure to back it up first.
Switch to the local repo directory and run the install script.
The install script will create symlinks in your home directory and then fetch the associated submodules from git.

```
cd ~/github/dot-neovim
./install.sh
```
